# cohost.org terms history

This repo contains an archive of our terms of service, community guidelines, and privacy policy changes over time. This repo was created on June 5, 2023; initial commit timestamps are from that date. The commit message indicates the date change.

The versions included in here are the `.mdx` files that were included in the site build; no changes were made for public release. This means that these files occasionally refer to internal libraries, namely our URL generating library.

You are welcome to base your site's policies off of these documents. However, we recommend you speak to a lawyer to ensure they work for your needs.
