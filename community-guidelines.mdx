# community guidelines

_last modified june 10, 2022_

thanks for using cohost! we ask everyone who uses cohost to follow a few rules
to keep cohost a healthy place to share stuff you care about.

if you think you can resolve a problem you’re having with someone’s behavior
without getting the site staff involved, we encourage you to. this obviously
saves us work, which we appreciate — but, more importantly, early interventions
from someone’s friends and acquaintances are way more likely to _actually fix_
someone’s bad behavior than letting it fester until we need to step in. please
feel free to get in touch with us if you think it’s something you can’t deal
with.

site staff reserves the right to take whatever action deemed necessary if these
guidelines are violated, including but not limited to: warnings, temporary
suspension, and site bans. all potential violations are manually reviewed by a
human being; we do not use any automated systems to take disciplinary action,
although we may use automated tooling to help detect certain violations.

all enforcement decisions can be appealed by replying to the enforcement notice,
which you will receive at the email you have listed in your account.

this list of guidelines and prohibited behaviors is as complete as we can
currently foresee, but we reserve the right to amend it in the future, and we
will provide you with notice when we do. conversely, behaviors which are _not_
listed herein are not necessarily endorsed by the staff; we reserve the right to
address misbehavior which is not covered by this list.

## abuse, harassment, and privacy

- do not post hateful or violent rhetoric directed toward any group of people
  on the basis of race, ethnic or national origin, sexual orientation, gender
  identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or disease.
  - some users may suffer from photosensitive epilepsy. we encourage
    everyone to use cohost’s content warning system to hide media with large
    flashing areas behind a click-through. to be clear, **do not post
    flashing images or video intending to trigger people’s epilepsy “as a
    joke”; it can cause serious and permanent injury.**
- do not abuse, harass, or threaten others.
  - do not attempt to contact someone who has taken action to stop you from
    contacting them, either on or off site.
  - do not intentionally refer to another person with incorrect pronouns or
    a former name/deadname.
- do not disclose the private information of a person without their consent,
  particularly (but not limited to) sensitive information like physical
  addresses, unlisted contact information, and government IDs.
- do not share intimate photos or videos of a person that were taken without
  their consent.
- do not impersonate others in a manner that is intended to, or does, mislead,
  confuse, or deceive others.
- do not publish or link to content intended to damage or disrupt another
  person’s computer or compromise their privacy.

## prohibited content

- do not post content which is illegal in the United States, or use cohost to
  conduct or facilitate illegal activities.
  - we are required by the DMCA to receive and process reports of copyright
    infringement from rightsholders and remove it upon a valid report. users
    who post content removed pursuant to a DMCA report can appeal it. you
    can find more information about our DMCA policies in our <a
    href={sitemap.public.staticContent({slug: "tos"}) }>terms of
    service.</a>
  - we have a moral and legal obligation to detect and remove child sexual
    exploitation material, and will cooperate fully with law enforcement in
    prosecuting anyone who posts it.
- do not post content that actively glorifies or promotes self-harm,
  terrorism, or human trafficking.
- do not post content that interferes with the integrity of local, regional,
  or national public office elections. this includes content designed to
  intentionally suppress, intimidate, or confuse voters.
- do not post spam, including but not limited to:
  - repeatedly following users or sharing or liking their posts in order to
    pester them with notifications;
  - posting large numbers of unwanted mentions or comments on other users’
    posts;
  - posting low value content which contains off-site links in an attempt to
    improve their search engine result ranking;
  - posting sponsored content without disclosing that you are receiving
    promotional consideration;
  - using an account or page largely to post solicitations to join referral
    marketing programs, make-money-from-home schemes, multi-level marketing,
    Ponzi schemes, or the like. we consider pretty much everything going on
    with cryptocurrency to be in this class of schemes, and uncritically
    promoting it is a violation of site policy.

## adult content

we consider the following things to be _adult content_ which should only be
accessible to users 18 and over:

- pornography or nudity, either photographic or drawn;
- other material which depicts or describes sexual acts in explicit detail.

for the purposes of this policy, we refer to content which isn’t adult content
as _all-ages._

unregistered users, and registered users who are under the age of 18, are unable
to see posts which are marked adult content. users over the age of 18 can also
choose to hide adult content behind a click-through by default, to prevent it
from unexpectedly appearing on their screen in public. if you often post adult
content from a particular page, you can set it as an adult content page to have
its new posts marked as adult content by default to avoid mistakes; even so, you
can still mark individual posts from that page as all-ages.

please do not post adult content in the following places:

- all-ages posts;
- comments on all-ages posts;
- your page’s profile picture or header image, **even if it is marked as an
  adult content page.** this content shows up in all-ages contexts.

if your page repeatedly or egregiously violates the site’s adult content policy,
all of the posts it makes may be marked as adult content automatically, without
you being able to unmark them.

## site integrity

- do not sell access to the site in unintended ways:
  - do not “username squat”: register accounts or pages under names you
    think will be worth money, then sell them.
  - do not sell cohost invitations. cohost isn’t designed to have a cover
    charge — not to put too fine a point on it, but if it was, we would be
    selling invitations ourselves — and we want everyone who wants a cohost
    account to be able to get one for free, even if they have to wait a bit.
- do not intentionally try to interfere with the operation of cohost itself.
  if you suspect cohost has a technical issue that could cause problems,
  please get in contact with us at support@cohost.org and we’ll work with you
  to get it fixed; we can’t afford a flashy big-dollar-value bug bounty
  program yet, but we’re happy to pay you to work as a consultant for your
  assistance in fixing severe issues.
- do not evade bans, or otherwise create multiple accounts or pages in an
  attempt to circumvent the moderation actions of site staff.

## behaviors to avoid

- sharing sensitive content without a descriptive content warning. the staff
  reserves the right to add or modify content warnings on posts without them,
  but we won’t lock or ban you for forgetting them. _sensitive content_
  includes but is not limited to:
  - depictions of graphic violence or self-harm;
  - depictions of sexual violence of all kinds;
  - depictions of explicit racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, or other
    bigotry in a documentary capacity (actually espousing these beliefs is
    prohibited);
  - depictions of abuse, particularly of children or animals;
  - depictions of drug use and abuse;
  - gross-out or shock content. a good rule of thumb is to not post without
    a content warning something that you or your friends wouldn’t appreciate
    seeing without a heads-up first.
- posting or reposting other people’s content without attribution.
  - if the content you want to share is already on cohost, please use the
    built-in share feature to boost it instead of reposting it.
  - if it’s not, make sure you link back to an original source. if the
    creator asks you to remove your post, change where you’re linking, or
    anything else, you should listen to them.
  - IMPORTANT TO NOTE: if your page repeatedly violates this, or is built
    around unsourced posting, we may ban you.
- sharing the content of private conversations with someone’s identity
  attached without a good reason.
  - it’s okay to call out really harmful behavior; it’s okay to laugh at
    something weird someone said if you post it without a name attached;
    it’s okay to anonymously amplify your friends’ good jokes from their alt
    pages. but please use discretion.
- trying to downplay bad behavior with “it’s just a joke” when said behavior
  was not even a little bit funny. we reserve the right to determine what
  “funny” is.
