# community guidelines

_last modified june 6, 2023_

thanks for using cohost! we ask everyone who uses cohost to follow a few rules
to keep the site a healthy place to share stuff you care about.

if you think you can resolve a problem you’re having with someone’s behavior
without getting the site staff involved, we encourage you to. this obviously
saves us work, which we appreciate — but, more importantly, early interventions
from someone’s friends and acquaintances are way more likely to _actually fix_
someone’s bad behavior than letting it fester until we need to step in. that
said, please get in touch with us if you think it’s something you can’t deal
with.

violations of these guidelines can be reported to site staff by clicking the
report button on any post, comment, or profile. the report button is located
within the menu represented by three dots next to the post, comment, or profile
in question. we _highly_ encourage you to use this reporting system, but if you
need to contact us about something else, you can do so at
[https://help.antisoftware.club](https://help.antisoftware.club/)

site staff reserves the right to take whatever action deemed necessary if these
guidelines are violated, including but not limited to: warnings, temporary
suspension, and site bans. all potential violations are manually reviewed by a
human being; we do not use any automated systems to take disciplinary action,
although we may use automated tooling to help detect certain violations.

all enforcement decisions can be appealed by replying to the enforcement notice,
which you will receive at the email you have listed in your account.

we reserve the right to amend these guidelines in the future, and we will
provide you with notice when we do. conversely, behaviors which are _not_ listed
herein are not necessarily endorsed by the staff; we reserve the right to
address misbehavior or abuse which is not covered by this list.

## abuse and harassment

- do not post hateful or violent rhetoric directed toward any group of people
  on the basis of race, ethnic or national origin, caste, sexual orientation,
  gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or disease.
- do not abuse, harass, or threaten others.
  - do not attempt to contact someone who has taken action to stop you from
    contacting them, either on or off site.
  - do not intentionally refer to another person with incorrect pronouns or
    a former name/deadname.
- some users may suffer from photosensitive epilepsy. we encourage everyone to
  use cohost’s content warning system to hide media with large flashing areas
  behind a click-through. to be clear, **do not post flashing images or video
  intending to trigger people’s epilepsy “as a joke”; it can cause serious and
  permanent injury.**

## privacy

- do not disclose the private information of a person without their consent,
  particularly (but not limited to) sensitive information like physical
  addresses, unlisted contact information, and government IDs.
- do not share intimate photos or videos of a person that were taken without
  their consent.
  - this includes adult content edited to appear to feature a different
    person (e.g. ”deepfakes”).
- do not impersonate others in a manner that is intended to, or does, mislead,
  confuse, or deceive others.
- do not publish or link to content intended to damage or disrupt another
  person’s computer or compromise their privacy, such as malware.

## site integrity

- do not sell access to the site in unintended ways:
  - do not “username squat”: register accounts or pages under names you
    think will be worth money, then sell them.
- do not intentionally try to interfere with the operation of cohost itself.
  if you suspect cohost has a technical issue that could cause problems,
  please get in contact with us at
  [support@cohost.org](mailto:support@cohost.org) and we’ll work with you to
  get it fixed; we can’t afford a flashy big-dollar-value bug bounty program
  yet, but we’re happy to pay you to work as a consultant for your assistance
  in fixing severe issues.
- do not evade bans, or otherwise create multiple accounts or pages in an
  attempt to circumvent the moderation actions of site staff.

## other prohibited content

- do not post content which is illegal in the United States, or use cohost to
  conduct or facilitate illegal activities.
  - child sexual abuse material is illegal, morally repugnant, and banned
    from cohost. we will fully cooperate with law enforcement in prosecuting
    anyone who posts it.
    - “child sexual abuse material” refers to realistic depictions of
      human minors, either actual photographs/videos, or visual art
      difficult to distinguish from actual photographs/videos
    - this also includes non-explicit depictions which are obviously
      intended to be sexual. (e.g. creepshots, underage “fashion
      modeling”, etc)
- do not post content that actively glorifies or promotes self-harm,
  terrorism, or human trafficking.
- do not post misleading content that would be likely to cause physical harm
  - for example, do not post harmful misinformation relating to the covid-19
    pandemic
- do not post content that interferes with the integrity of local, regional,
  or national public office elections. this includes content designed to
  intentionally suppress, intimidate, or confuse voters.
- do not post spam, including but not limited to:
  - repeatedly following users or sharing or liking their posts in order to
    pester them with notifications;
  - posting large numbers of unwanted mentions or comments on other users’
    posts;
  - posting low value content which contains off-site links in an attempt to
    improve their search engine result ranking;
  - posting sponsored content without disclosing that you are receiving
    promotional consideration;
  - using an account or page largely to post solicitations to join referral
    marketing programs, make-money-from-home schemes, multi-level marketing,
    Ponzi schemes, or the like. we consider pretty much everything going on
    with cryptocurrency to be in this class of schemes, and uncritically
    promoting it is a violation of site policy.
- we are required by the DMCA to receive and process reports of copyright
  infringement from rightsholders and remove it upon a valid report. users who
  post content removed pursuant to a DMCA report can appeal it. you can find
  more information about our DMCA policies in our
  [terms of service.](https://cohost.org/rc/content/tos)

## 18+ content

we consider the following things to be _18+ content_ which should only be
accessible to users 18 and over:

- pornography or nudity, either photographic or drawn;
- other material which depicts or describes sexual acts in explicit detail.

for the purposes of this policy, we refer to content which isn’t 18+ content as
_all-ages._

please do not post 18+ content in the following places:

- all-ages posts;
- comments on all-ages posts;
- your page’s profile picture or header image, **even if it is marked as an
  18+ content page.** this content shows up in all-ages contexts.

registered users who are under the age of 18 are unable to see posts which are
marked 18+ content; unregistered users must attest that they're over the age of
18 before viewing it. users over the age of 18 can also choose to hide 18+
content behind a click-through by default, to prevent it from unexpectedly
appearing on their screen in public. if you often post 18+ content from a
particular page, you can set it as an 18+ content page to have its new posts
marked as 18+ content by default to avoid mistakes; even so, you can still mark
individual posts from that page as all-ages.

### fictional 18+ content featuring minors

- do not post photography or photorealistic depictions of minors
  - as described above, photography and photorealistic sexual depictions of
    human minors are illegal, morally repugnant, and banned from cohost.
    please refer to that section (under “other prohibited content”) for full
    details.
- do not post sexually explicit non-photorealistic visual art of fictional
  humans (including characters that appear to be human) who are apparently
  minors.
  - we will not be using third-party evidence (i.e. fan wikis) when
    determining if a character depicted is a minor.
  - non-explicit art with suggestive themes is allowed with a **mandatory**
    content warning
- written material is generally permitted with a mandatory content warning,
  barring two major restrictions:
  - do not post written fiction involving real people (i.e. RPF) who are
    minors or depicted as minors.
    - this does not apply to content written in a documentary capacity
      (e.g. describing personal experiences) however these instances must
      include a content warning
  - do not post anything encouraging, glorifying, or advocating sex between
    adults and minors.

## content warnings

cohost allows for creators to provide content warnings for posts containing
sensitive content.

**for most sensitive content**, content warnings are optional but _strongly
recommended_. the staff reserves the right to add or modify content warnings on
posts without them, but in most cases we won’t lock or ban you for forgetting
them.

_sensitive content_ includes but is not limited to:

- depictions of graphic violence or self-harm;
- depictions of sexual violence of all kinds;
- depictions of explicit racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, or other
  bigotry in a documentary capacity (actually espousing these beliefs is
  prohibited);
- depictions of abuse, particularly of children or animals;
- depictions of drug use and abuse; descriptions of self-harm, suicide, or
  suicide baiting (telling people to commit suicide) in a documentary
  capacity;
- gross-out or shock content. a good rule of thumb is to not post without a
  content warning something that you or your friends wouldn’t appreciate
  seeing without a heads-up first.

**however, there is a list of content warnings that we consider to be
mandatory** (”mandatory content warnings”) on posts which are described by them;
the site automatically behaves differently for these in the following ways:

- posts with mandatory content warnings will _only_ be hidden from general tag
  search results. these posts appear as normal on the poster’s profile, as
  well as on your stream if you follow them.
- for example: posts tagged with the mandatory content warning “noncon” _will
  not_ appear in search results for #fanart but _will_ appear in direct tag
  searches for #noncon.

the list of mandatory content warnings can be found
[on our support site](https://help.antisoftware.club/support/solutions/articles/62000226150-mandatory-content-warnings).

**if your post calls for any content warning included in this list,** you
**MUST** include a content warning. if you accidentally forget to include a
mandatory content warning, we’ll go in and add it for you and remind you to be
more careful. however, **repeatedly failing to add mandatory content warnings,
or intentionally attempting to circumvent the site filters (”n0nc0n”),** is
**entirely prohibited** and punishable with a ban.

## behaviors to avoid

we discourage you from taking these actions, but once-off doing so does not
necessarily warrant an instant warning or punishment. Repeated or severe
violations will still be dealt with accordingly.

- posting or reposting other people’s content without attribution.
  - if the content you want to share is already on cohost, please use the
    built-in share feature to boost it instead of reposting it.
  - if it’s not, make sure you link back to an original source. if the
    creator asks you to remove your post, change where you’re linking, or
    anything else, you should listen to them.
  - IMPORTANT TO NOTE: if your page is built around unsourced posting, we
    may ban you.
- sharing the content of private conversations with someone’s identity
  attached without a good reason.
  - it’s okay to call out really harmful behavior; it’s okay to laugh at
    something weird someone said if you post it without a name attached;
    it’s okay to anonymously amplify your friends’ good jokes from their alt
    pages. but please use discretion.
- trying to downplay bad behavior with “it’s just a joke” when said behavior
  was not even a little bit funny. we reserve the right to determine what
  “funny” is.

if you have questions about anything listed here, please email us at
