# ASSC Terms of Use

_Last Updated June 29, 2022_

These Terms of Use (or "Terms") are between you and the Anti Software Software
Club LLC and our affiliates ("ASSC", "us" or "we") and, together with our
Privacy Notice, govern your use of https://cohost.org/,
https://antisoftware.club/, and other websites and platforms we own or control
(collectively, the "Site"), mobile applications, products, merchandise, other
services, or any portion thereof (the "Services"). Capitalized terms we use
without providing a definition have the meaning given to them in the <a
href={sitemap.public.staticContent({slug: "privacy"})}>Privacy Notice</a>.
Additional, separate terms may apply to our Services, each of which will be
considered to form part of these Terms.

THESE TERMS INCLUDE A CLASS ACTION WAIVER AND AN ARBITRATION PROVISION THAT
GOVERNS ANY DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND ASSC.

If you have any questions about these Terms or our Services, please contact us
at support@cohost.org.

1.  **Acceptance.** To use our Services, you must agree to be unconditionally
    bound by these Terms. You accept the Terms by clicking to accept or agree to
    the Terms where this option is made available to you in any agreement or
    electronic form, or by visiting the Site or using another Service. If you
    are using or accessing the Services on behalf of a company or other entity
    ("Entity"), you represent, agree, and warrant that you are authorized to act
    on behalf of the Entity and to bind such Entity to these Terms. You must be
    of legal age and capacity to form a binding contract to accept the Terms. If
    you do not agree with any of these Terms, do not access the Site or use our
    Services.

2.  **Eligibility.** To use the Services, you must be (a) at least 18 years of
    age or (b) at least 16 years of age and your legal guardian must give ASSC
    prior express written consent to your use of the Services, as demonstrated
    by your legal guardian accepting these Terms on your behalf. By using the
    Services, you represent and warrant that you are of legal age to form a
    binding contract with us for yourself or your child and that you meet all of
    the foregoing eligibility requirements. You may not access or use the
    Services if you are barred from receiving such services under applicable law
    or have previously been suspended or removed from any of our Services. If
    you do not meet all of these requirements, you must not use our Services.

3.  **Services.** The Services provide registered users and content creators
    ("Users") access to a social media platform that allows Users to
    communicate, post content, offer other Users paid subscriptions to access
    exclusive content, and engage in transactions for digital offerings on a
    User marketplace. ASSC reserves the right to suspend or terminate your use
    of the Services at any time if we believe you have violated these Terms or
    any other agreement with us, or any of ASSC's policies or protocols.

    As a User, you gain access to the Services for free or you can subscribe to
    the Services for the fee stated when you signup. You will have access to
    other Users' content and digital assets posted to the Services for others to
    enjoy.

    ASSC may offer Users the option to offer content or digital assets in
    exchange for a one-time or subscription fee ("Paid Content"). If this option
    is available to you and you post Paid Content, you will receive a designated
    percentage of the Fees (as defined in Section 9.1) paid by other Users for
    such access in the form of currency or account credit.

4.  **License Grant.** ASSC hereby grants you a revocable, nontransferable,
    nonexclusive license to access, view information contained on, and interact
    with the Site and other Services, as applicable, solely for your own
    personal use. You may not use the Services for any commercial purpose
    (except when transacting business with ASSC or with another User via the
    Services) or for any unlawful or wrongful purpose. You agree not to rent,
    retransmit, disclose, publish, sell, assign, lease, sublicense, market or
    transfer the Services or any portion of it (including the Contents) or use
    it in any manner not expressly authorized by these Terms. You further agree
    not to copy, reverse engineer, translate, port, modify or make derivative
    works of any portion of the Services. Tampering with the Services,
    conducting fraudulent activities via the Services, and all other illegal
    activities are prohibited and may subject a user to legal action and/or
    termination of your access to the Services. By using the Services or
    features thereof, you represent and warrant that (i) any information you
    submit to us is truthful and accurate, (ii) you will maintain the accuracy
    of that information, and (iii) your use of the Services and its features
    does not violate any applicable law, rule or regulation. Any information
    that you provide to us will also be subject to our Privacy Notice.

5.  **Registration**. Anyone may visit the Site, but to use most features of the
    Services you must register as a User and create an account by selecting
    login credentials (username and password) and provide us with accurate
    contact information and other information about yourself. You agree (i) to
    provide correct, current and complete information as prompted by the account
    creation form, and maintain and update such information as needed to keep it
    correct, current and complete; (ii) register only once using a single
    username; (iii) not to do anything that might jeopardize the security of
    your account; and (iv) to notify us immediately of any unauthorized access
    to or use of your credentials or any other breach of security. You are
    responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials
    and for all activities that occur on your account.

    You agree to not (a) register on behalf of another person without the legal
    authority to do so; (b) register under the name of another person; (c)
    choose a username that constitutes or suggests an impersonation of any other
    person (real or fictitious) or entity or that you are a representative of an
    entity when you are not, or that is offensive; (d) choose a username for the
    purposes of deceiving or misleading our users and/or us as to your true
    identity; or (e) choose a username that incorporates a solicitation. You are
    strictly prohibited from sharing your login credentials with any third
    party, or otherwise permitting a third party to use the Services via your
    account.

6.  **User Content.** Users may upload, post, provide, publish, display, store,
    comment on, link to, or otherwise make available via the Services media,
    materials, attachments, digital goods or services, or other content ("User
    Content"). You agree to only post User Content that you own and that abides
    by our <a href={sitemap.public.staticContent({slug:
    "community-guidelines"})}>Community Guidelines</a>. You may not post User
    Content that infringes others' intellectual property or proprietary rights.
    You understand that any User Content you make available may be viewed by and
    accessible to ASSC and other Users. You agree to provide support for your
    User Content. The User Content must not be stored in a data repository that
    would enable any third-party access. You must store all User Content in a
    manner which enables you to identify, segregate and selectively delete such
    User Content.

    You must own all rights, title, and interest, including all intellectual
    property rights, in and to, the User Content you make available on the
    Services. ASSC requires licenses from you for that User Content to operate
    the Services. By posting User Content on the Services, you grant ASSC a
    royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, sublicensable,
    worldwide license to use, reproduce, distribute, perform, publicly display
    or prepare derivative works of your User Content.

7.  **User Content License.** If you make your User Content available to other
    Users, whether for free or on a purchase or subscription basis, you grant
    other Users a revocable, nontransferable, nonexclusive license to access,
    view information contained on, and interact with such User Content for the
    other User's personal, non-commercial use. If you access, purchase, or
    subscribe to another User's User Content: (i) you may not use such User
    Content for any commercial purpose or for any unlawful or wrongful purpose;
    (ii) you agree not to rent, retransmit, disclose, publish, sell, assign,
    lease, sublicense, market or transfer the User Content or any portion of it
    or use it in any unauthorized manner; and (iii) you agree to not copy,
    reverse engineer, translate, port, modify or make derivative works of any
    portion of the User Content without the User's express permission.

8.  **Responsibility for User Content.** You agree that ASSC only acts as a
    passive conduit for online distribution and publication of User Content.
    ASSC is not responsible for policing the Services or any User Content. ASSC
    does not and will not have any obligation to review User Content, and
    therefore we do not guarantee the accuracy, integrity, or quality thereof
    and we cannot assure you that harmful, inaccurate, deceptive, offensive,
    threatening, defamatory, unlawful, or otherwise objectionable User Content
    will not appear on the Services. You understand and agree that any loss or
    damage of any kind that occurs as a result of the use of any User Content
    that you send, upload, download, stream, post, transmit, display, or
    otherwise make available or access through your use of the Services, is
    solely your responsibility. Without limiting the foregoing, ASSC reserves
    the right to collect and store any User Content, as well as any files,
    documents, or data related thereto, uploaded or generated via the Services
    on ASSC's information systems indefinitely in order to track and analyze
    work performed using the Services, or for any other lawful purpose. To the
    extent permitted by law, ASSC reserves the right to review and remove any or
    all User Content in our sole discretion, in whole or in part. UNDER NO
    CIRCUMSTANCES WILL ASSC BE LIABLE IN ANY WAY FOR ANY USER CONTENT POSTED ON
    OR MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICES BY YOU OR ANY OTHER USER.

    Any User Content, Feedback, posts to Community Forums, or other posts to the
    Services is subject to our approval. We may withhold such approval for any
    reason, including but not limited to, if we believe such post(s) may violate
    these Terms, any law, or the rights of any third party. We reserve the right
    to remove any posts to the Services for any reason, but we have no
    obligation to police User activity.

9.  **Billing and Payment.** This Section 8 applies if your use of the Services
    incurs a fee.

    1.  **Fees.** You agree to pay the costs and fees for all User Content,
        Merchandise, and other subscriptions or purchases you make on the
        Services, plus any applicable sales, use, excise, or other taxes
        (collectively, the "Fees"). Fee amounts are subject to change from time
        to time. You will pay any additional taxes as necessary to ensure that
        the net amounts received by ASSC after all such taxes are paid are equal
        to the amounts that ASSC would have been entitled to in accordance with
        these Terms as if the taxes did not exist. If you do not pay on time or
        if we cannot charge the payment method you have on file for any reason,
        ASSC reserves the right to either suspend or terminate your access to
        paid features on the Services. All Fees are in U.S. Dollars. PAID FEES
        ARE NONREFUNDABLE.

    2.  **Payment Method.** You must maintain a valid payment method on file
        with us, which is securely stored and processed via a PCI-DSS payment
        processor. If your payment method is a credit card, we may seek
        pre-authorization of your account to verify that the credit card is
        valid and has the necessary funds or credit available to cover your
        Fees. You represent and warrant that the payment information you provide
        to us is accurate and you are using a form of payment that you are
        legally authorized to use. You agree that you are solely liable for any
        payment or credit card fraud, abuse or unauthorized use by you or
        others.

    3.  **Authorization.** You agree that we may charge your payment method on
        file with us for the Fees or other amounts due hereunder, as well as any
        sales and use taxes and any late fees or interest (as described below).
        If you select a subscription with automatically recurring payments, you
        authorize ASSC to periodically charge your payment method on a
        going-forward basis for all accrued sums and until cancellation of
        either the recurring payments or your account.

10. **Merchandise.** We may sell certain products or goods on the Services or
    through a third-party platform ("Merchandise"). These Terms govern your
    purchase of any Merchandise. All Merchandise prices listed are final and are
    subject to change in our sole discretion from time-to-time. Merchandise
    payments are processed through a PCI-DSS compliant third-party payment
    processor. All Merchandise is the sole intellectual property, including
    copyright and trademark, owned by ASSC and is not for your commercial or
    resale purposes. Merchandise purchased on a third-party website will be
    subject to the third-party terms and policies, and we will not be held
    liable for any issues you run into while purchasing Merchandise through any
    source other than our Services.

11. **Contents and Ownership.** Except as otherwise expressly indicated herein,
    **ASSC** owns all rights, title, and interest, including all intellectual
    property rights, in and to, the Services and all elements, components, and
    executables (including without limitation all Merchandise, Feedback, User
    posts to Community Forums, images, illustrations, designs, photographs,
    video clips, text, graphics, icons, designs, software code, written
    information and screens appearing on the Services, and other materials, as
    well as names, logos, taglines, trade dress, and other trademarks therein)
    on the Services (the "Contents"). The Contents are protected by U.S. and
    foreign copyright, trademark, trade dress, or other proprietary right laws
    and international conventions. Nothing in these Terms is intended to
    transfer to you any rights to the Contents or grant you any license to the
    Contents, except as specifically set forth in these Terms. Only a duly
    authorized officer of ASSC may grant permission or a license to use any of
    the Contents; any attempted grant or similar promise by anyone other than a
    duly authorized agent of ASSC is invalid.

    1.  **Copyright.** You do not have permission to copy, reproduce, make
        derivative works from, distribute, republish, download, display,
        perform, post electronically or mechanically, transmit, record, or
        mirror any of the Contents without the prior written permission of ASSC.
        You may only display, download, and print in hard copy format the
        Contents for the purposes of using the Site as an internal or personal
        business resource.

    2.  **Trademarks.** ASSC's registered and unregistered trademarks and trade
        dress, including names, logos, taglines, trade dress, and other
        trademarks, may not be copied, imitated, or used, whether in whole,
        partial or modified form, without the prior written permission of ASSC.
        You may not use any meta tags or any other hidden text utilizing an ASSC
        name, trademark, or product name without ASSC's prior written
        permission. Third-party trademarks and service marks used on the
        Services are the property of their respective owners, and we use them
        with their consent. ASSC and the other licensors of the marks on the
        Site reserve all rights with respect to all Contents and all
        intellectual property.

    3.  **Feedback.** While using the Services, you may provide us certain
        materials, communications, suggestions, comments, improvements, ideas or
        other feedback related to the Services ("Feedback"). You are solely
        responsible for your Feedback. You hereby grant to ASSC all rights,
        titles and interests in and to any Feedback. In the event this grant is
        not sufficient for us to fully realize and use the Feedback, you grant
        us a royalty-free, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable,
        perpetual license to use and incorporate into the Services any of the
        Feedback. By providing Feedback, you are representing that the Feedback
        is not subject to any intellectual property claim by a third party or
        any license terms which would require products or services derived from
        that Feedback to be licensed to or from, or shared with, any third
        party.

12. **Community Forums.** The Services offer features that allow Users to
    communicate with one another and with ASSC such as comments, discussion
    forums, listings, and other features ("Community Forums"), all posts (and
    attachments) to which are ASSC Content. You are solely responsible for your
    use of Community Forums and use them at your own risk. You are responsible
    for all usage and activity in the Community Forums through your username and
    password, including use of your username and password by any third party.
    You should be aware that disclosure in the Community Forums of your full
    name, street address or other personal information raises safety concerns
    and may result in solicitations from third parties or unwanted
    communications. We disclaim any responsibility or liability arising from
    your disclosure of such personal information, or any other information, in
    the Community Forums.

13. **Use Restrictions.** You agree not to rent, retransmit, disclose, publish,
    sell, assign, lease, sublicense, market or transfer the Services or any
    portion thereof (including our Content) or use it in any manner not
    expressly authorized by these Terms. You may not use the Services for any
    unlawful or wrongful purpose. You further agree not to copy, reverse
    engineer, translate, port, modify or make derivative works of any portion of
    the Services. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you
    understand and agree that you will not:

    - Use the Services or our Content for any purpose except in connection

    - Use the user identification or authentication codes connected to any
      ASSC user to disclose information related to that user to any third
      party.

    - Implement features or business practices that unlawfully harm the

      when requesting or publishing information related to your use of the

14. **Support.** ASSC may provide technical support, upgrades, or modifications
    of the Services in ASSC's sole discretion. ASSC may cease providing
    technical support, upgrades, or modifications of the Services at any time
    and for any reason without notice or liability to you. ASSC may release new
    versions of the Services and require you to use the new version of the
    Services. Your use of new releases or versions of the Services will be
    acceptance of all modifications of the Services. ASSC may, in our sole
    discretion, make specific instances or versions of the Services available to
    you for use in connection with the Services. We may terminate such access to
    the Services, in whole or as to certain features, functions, or services
    thereof, for convenience, at any time.

15. **Compliance.** You represent and warrant that (i) any information you
    submit to us is truthful and accurate; (ii) you will maintain the accuracy
    of that information; (iii) you have and will at all times maintain the right
    to provide all User Content provided by you hereunder; (iv) your User
    Content and any other materials you provide or submit to other Users or ASSC
    do not infringe the intellectual property or other rights of any third

    code; and (v) your use of the Services and its features does not violate any
    Applicable Law.

16. **Communications from ASSC.** We may use your contact information you
    provide to us to communicate with you about your use of the Services. For
    example, we may send you service announcements or administrative
    communications by email, phone, text, or other means. You understand that
    you receive these communications as part of your use of the Services. We may
    send you marketing communications by email, mail, or other means in
    compliance with applicable law. As part of our policy to respect your
    privacy, we provide you the option of opting out from receiving marketing
    communications from us by following the instructions in our Privacy Notice.
    However, you will not be able to opt out from receiving service
    announcements and administrative messages.

17. **Data Security.** Your network, operating system, and software of your web
    servers, databases, and computer systems (collectively "**Systems**") must
    be properly configured to securely use the Services. Your User Content must
    use reasonable security measures to protect our Content and any elements or
    components of the Services. You shall not architect, design, or select
    Systems in a manner to avoid these obligations. You must promptly report to
    ASSC at [support@cohost.org](mailto:support@cohost.org) any security
    deficiencies in, or intrusions into, your Systems that you discover. You
    will work with ASSC to correct any security deficiency and disconnect any
    intrusions or intruders as soon as practicable upon discovery of any such
    deficiency or intrusion. In the event of any security deficiency or
    intrusion involving the Services or our Content, you will make no public
    statements without prior written and express permission from ASSC in each
    instance, unless otherwise required by law.

    You hereby agree not to use any device, software or routine to interfere or
    try to interfere with the proper working of the Services or any activity
    being conducted thereon. You further agree not to use or try to use any
    engine, software, tool, agent or other device or mechanism (including
    browsers, spiders, robots, avatars or intelligent agents) to navigate or
    search the Services other than the search engine and search agents that we
    make available via the Services and other than the generally available
    third-party web browsers. If you violate our system or network security, you
    may face civil or criminal liability. We will investigate occurrences that
    may involve such violations. We may involve or cooperate with law
    enforcement authorities in prosecuting users who are involved in such
    violations.

18. **Confidential Information.** You agree that the Services and ASSC Content
    are deemed to be our confidential information and you will maintain the same
    in strict confidence and not disclose the same to any third party or use the
    same for any purpose other than your use of the Services. To the extent that
    you retain any Content after the termination or expiration of the Terms,
    this paragraph will survive the termination or expiration of the Terms.

19. **Consent to Do Business Electronically.** By using our Services in any
    manner, registering as a User, or typing your name into any of our
    electronic forms and indicating your acceptance or submission of information
    by clicking a box, you affirmatively consent to (i) ASSC communicating with
    you electronically; (ii) receiving all applications, notices, disclosures
    and authorizations (collectively, "Records") from ASSC electronically; and
    (iii) entering into agreements and transactions using electronic Records and
    signatures. Please note that federal law treats electronic signatures as
    having the same legal force and effect as if they were signed on paper by
    hand, and online contracts have the same legal force as signing an
    equivalent paper contract in ink. You must have a computer or other
    web-enabled device, connection to the internet, an active email account, and
    the ability to receive and read PDF files (such as Adobe® Acrobat® Reader)
    to conduct business with us electronically. You agree to be responsible for
    keeping your own Records. You may print or download Records from the Site
    and keep them for your own reference. If you require assistance with your
    Records or if you wish to receive Records in paper format or to withdraw
    your consent to receiving electronic Records from us, please contact us at
    [support@cohost.org](mailto:support@cohost.org). Agreements and transactions
    executed prior to this request will remain valid and enforceable.

20. **Copyright Policy; DMCA.** We respect the intellectual property rights of
    others and expect users of the Service to do the same. We will respond to
    notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with applicable law
    and are properly provided to our designated copyright agent ("Copyright
    Agent"). Our designated Copyright Agent to receive notifications of claimed
    infringement is:

    > Jonathan Bailey

    > New Orleans, LA 70131

    If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof and believe that any
    Content infringes upon your copyrights, you may submit a notification
    pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") by providing our
    Copyright Agent with the following information in writing (see 17 U.S.C
    512(c)(3) for further detail):

    - A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on
      behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;

    - Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed,
      or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by
      a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site;

    - Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be
      the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed, or access
      to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to
      permit the service provider to locate the material;

    - Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact you, such as
      an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail;

    - A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material
      in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner,
      its agent, or the law; and

    - A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and
      under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of
      the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

21. **Void Where Prohibited.** The Services are owned and operated in the United
    States. Not all of our Services are available to all persons or at all
    locations. Access to our Services may not be legal by certain persons or in
    certain countries. YOu are solely responsible for verifying that the laws of
    the country or state (or other applicable jurisdiction) from which you
    access the SERVICES permit you to USE the SERVICES. If you access the
    Services from outside the United States, you do so on your own initiative
    and are responsible for compliance with local laws. We reserve the right to
    limit, at our sole discretion, the provision of any such Services to any
    person or in any location. Any offer of a Service in these Terms shall be
    deemed void where prohibited.

23. **Term and Termination.** The term of these Terms starts on the first day
    you access, use, or register as a User (whichever is earliest) on the
    Services and continues until you discontinue all use of our Services or
    until otherwise terminated as provided herein. If you purchase a
    subscription, unless otherwise stated at the time of subscription the
    subscription will automatically renew at the conclusion of each subscription
    term if you do not first cancel or change your subscription. ASSC may
    terminate your access to all or any part of the Services at any time, with
    or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately, which may
    result in the forfeiture and destruction of all information associated with
    your User account. All provisions of these Terms of Use, which by their
    nature should survive termination, shall survive termination, including,
    without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity
    and limitations of liability.

24. **Disclaimer of Warranties.** YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES IS AT YOUR OWN RISK.
    ASSC MAKES NO EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, OR
    GUARANTEES IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES OR RELATING TO THE AVAILABILITY,
    QUALITY, RELIABILITY, SUITABILITY, TIMELINESS, TRUTH, ACCURACY OR
    COMPLETENESS OF THE SERVICES. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
    LAW, THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED TO YOU ON AN "AS IS," "AS AVAILABLE" AND
    "WHERE-IS" BASIS WITH NO WARRANTY OF IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY,
    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS.
    ASSC does not warrant that the SERVICES will meet all of your requirements
    or that its operations will be uninterrupted or error free, or that any
    defect within the Services will be corrected. No oral or written
    information, representation or advice given by ASSC shall create a warranty
    without a writing signed by ASSC EXPRESSLY CREATING such warranty.

25. **Indemnification.** You agree to indemnify and hold ASSC, our subsidiaries
    and our affiliates, and their respective MEMBERS, directors, SHAREHOLDERS,
    officers, agents, partners and employees, harmless from any loss, liability,
    cost, expense, claim, damages, or demand, including without limitation
    reasonable attorneys' fees, due or relating to or arising out of (i) your
    use of THE SERVICES in violation of THIS AGREEMENT, (ii) your breach of
    THESE TERMS, or (iii) any breach of your representations and warranties set
    forth in THESE TERMS.

26. **Limited Liability.** ASSC SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY DAMAGES
    RESULTING FROM YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY
    APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL ASSC BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT,
    EXTRAORDINARY, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
    DAMAGES OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, REVENUE, PROFITS, USE OR OTHER ECONOMIC
    ADVANTAGE, HOWEVER ARISING, EVEN IF ASSC KNOWS THERE IS A POSSIBILITY OF
    SUCH DAMAGE. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, IN NO EVENT SHALL ASSC BE
    LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY AMOUNTS THAT, TOGETHER WITH AMOUNTS ASSOCIATED WITH
    ALL OTHER CLAIMS, EXCEED THE AGGREGATE OF THE FEES PAID BY YOU TO ASSC FOR
    THE SERVICES DURING THE THREE MONTHS PRIOR TO THE ACT THAT GAVE RISE TO THE
    LIABILITY OR, IF NO FEES WERE PAID DURING SUCH THREE MONTH PERIOD, ONE
    HUNDRED US DOLLARS (\$100), IN EACH CASE, WHETHER OR NOT ASSC HAS BEEN
    ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

27. **Class Action Waiver.** You hereby waive any right to commence or
    participate in any class action lawsuit against ASSC related to any claim,
    dispute or controversy, and, where applicable, you hereby agree to opt out
    of any class proceeding against ASSC otherwise commenced ON OR AFTER THE
    EFFECTIVE DATE OF this AGREEMENT.

28. **Dispute Resolution.** PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE
    IT CONTAINS A CLASS ACTION WAIVER, REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN
    DISPUTES~~,~~ AND CLAIMS, AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF
    FROM US. You agree that any dispute, controversy or claim between you and
    ASSC arising out of or relating to these Terms, or the breach thereof, our
    provision of the Services, your access to or use of the Services, or any
    alleged violation of any federal, state, or local law, statute, or ordinance
    (each such dispute, controversy or claim, a "Dispute") will be governed by
    the procedure outlined below. In the event of any Dispute between the
    Parties concerning the terms and provisions of these Terms, the prevailing
    Party shall be entitled to collect from the other Party all costs incurred
    in such dispute, including reasonable attorneys' fees.

    1.  **Informal Dispute Resolution.** We want to address your concerns
        without the necessity of a formal legal case. Before filing a claim
        against ASSC, you agree to try to resolve the Dispute informally by
        contacting [support@cohost.org](support@cohost.org). ASSC will contact
        you by email as part of a good faith effort to resolve the Dispute
        informally. If a Dispute is not resolved within 30 days after
        submission, you or ASSC may bring a formal proceeding.

    2.  **Arbitration Agreement.** You and ASSC each agree to resolve any
        Disputes through final and binding arbitration administered by the
        American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Commercial Arbitration
        Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes.
        The arbitration will be held in Seattle, Washington, United States, or
        any other location we agree to. The AAA rules will govern payment of all
        arbitration fees. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or ASSC may
        assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in King County,
        Washington or any United States county where you live or work. Either
        party may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop
        unauthorized use or abuse of our Services, or infringement of
        intellectual property rights (for example, trademark, trade secret,
        copyright, or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or
        the informal dispute resolution process described above.

    3.  **Class Action Waiver.** You may only resolve Disputes with ASSC on an
        individual basis and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class
        member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. Class
        arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and
        consolidation with other arbitrations are not allowed under these Terms.

    4.  **Intellectual Property Disputes.** Notwithstanding the Parties\'
        decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may
        bring an action in state or federal court that only asserts claims for
        patent infringement or invalidity, copyright infringement, moral rights
        violations, trademark infringement, and/or trade secret
        misappropriation, but not, for clarity, claims related to the license
        granted to you for the Services under these Terms. Either Party may also
        seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the
        scope of that court\'s jurisdiction.

    5.  **Limitation on Claims.** Regardless of any statute or law to the
        contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to your
        use of the Services must be filed within one (1) year after such claim
        or cause of action arose, or else that claim or cause of action will be
        barred forever. To the extent that the arbitration agreement is not
        enforceable, each party hereby irrevocably consents to the exclusive
        jurisdiction and venue of the federal, state, and local courts in King
        County, Washington for resolution of any lawsuit or court proceeding
        permitted under these Terms.

29. **General Terms.** You may not assign, delegate, or transfer these Terms or
    your rights or obligations hereunder in any way (by operation of law or
    otherwise) without prior written consent from ASSC. We may transfer, assign,
    or delegate these Terms and our rights and obligations without consent. This
    Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect
    to the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this Agreement is held by
    a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, the provision shall
    be modified by the court and interpreted so as to best accomplish the
    objectives of the original provision to the fullest extent permitted by law,
    and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in effect.
    ASSC's failure to enforce any provision of these Terms will not be deemed a
    waiver of that provision or any other provision of these Terms. If any
    provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable under applicable
    law, that portion shall be construed in a manner consistent with applicable
    law to accomplish, as nearly as possible, the objective thereof, or shall be
    severed from the document if, and solely, to the limited extent such
    construction is not possible, and the remaining portion of these Terms shall
    remain in full force and effect. These Terms may be executed by the parties
    in one or more counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered
    shall be an original and such counterparts shall together constitute one and
    the same instrument. No joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency
    relationship exists between you and ASSC as a result of these Terms or your
    use of the Services.

30. **Amendments.** We may amend these Terms from time to time by updating this
    page as evidenced by revising the "Last Updated" date noted at the top of
    this posting. Once you accept these Terms, the then-current version shall
    apply each time you access or use the Services. Nothing in these Terms will
    be deemed to confer any third-party rights or benefits.
